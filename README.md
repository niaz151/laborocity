### Noticeable Differences: ###

1. Dropdown Menu is composed of switches instead of sliders
   
   Explanantion:
   
   As this was my first time using ReduxForm I had trouble trying to utilize a range slider in combination with the ReduxForm methods and    way of data transfer
   
   
 2. Switch Div Width Not Pixel-Matching the 345px on Figma
    
    Explanation: 
    
    Since the majority of the time I would be viewing this on desktop and it needs to be responsive I just chose to make it a much more         reasonable width while being used through a larger screen
    
 
 ### Potential Issues with Figma Design ###
 
 1. In the General Labor submenu the item 'Restoration' is repeated twice
 
 2. After succcesfully picking a skill and reaching the alternate equipment screen, the word 'equipment' is misspelled


### Features ###

 1. I was succesfully able to link the reduxForm into the store and update form values in real time 
 
 2. Subsequently, I was able to use the aforementioned store updates to verify if a user has 'skills' and can access the alternate             equipment page 
   
 3. The application is currently being hosted on laborocity-sample.surge.sh (this is using the program I brought up during the interview)


### What's Left To Do? ###

1. Make the Labor submenu show/hide depending on the value of the category slider

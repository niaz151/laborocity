### Noticeable Differences: ###

1. Dropdown Menu is composed of switches instead of sliders
   
   Explanantion:
   
   As this was my first time using ReduxForm I had trouble trying to utilize a range slider in combination with the ReduxForm methods and    way of data transfer
   
   
 2. Switch Div Width Not Pixel-Matching the 345pm on Figma
    
    Explanation: 
    
    Since the majority of the time I would be viewing this on desktop and it needs to be respnsive I just chose to make it a much more         reasonale width while being used through a larger screen
    
 
 ### Potential Issues with Figma Design ###
 
 1. In the General Labor submenu the item 'Restoration' is repeated twice
 
 2. After succcesfully picking a skill and reaching the alternate equipment screen, the word 'equipment' is mispelled
